    <h3 id="etymology">Etymology</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Before the unification of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley was known as Nepal.[c] The precise origin of the term Nepāl
        is uncertain. Nepal appears in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far back as the fourth century BC.[which?]
        An absolute chronology can not be established, as even the oldest texts may contain anonymous contributions
        dating as late as the early modern period. Academic attempts to provide a plausible theory are hindered by the
        lack of a complete picture of history and insufficient understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo-European
        and Tibeto-Burman languages.[17]

        According to Hindu mythology, Nepal derives its name from an ancient Hindu sage called Ne, referred to variously
        as Ne Muni or Nemi. According to Pashupati Purāna, as a place protected by Ne, the country in the heart of the
        Himalayas came to be known as Nepāl.[18][19][d] According to Nepāl Mahātmya,[e] Nemi was charged with protection
        of the country by Pashupati.[20] According to Buddhist mythology, Manjushri Bodhisattva drained a primordial
        lake of serpents to create the Nepal valley and proclaimed that Adi-Buddha Ne would take care of the community
        that would settle it. As the cherished of Ne, the valley would be called Nepāl.[21] According to
        Gopalarājvamshāvali, the genealogy of ancient Gopala dynasty compiled c. 1380s, Nepal is named after Nepa the
        cowherd, the founder of the Nepali scion of the Abhiras. In this account, the cow that issued milk to the spot,
        at which Nepa discovered the Jyotirlinga of Pashupatināth upon investigation, was also named Ne.[17]

        Norwegian indologist Christian Lassen had proposed that Nepāla was a compound of Nipa (foot of a mountain) and
        -ala (short suffix for alaya meaning abode), and so Nepāla meant "abode at the foot of the mountain". He
        considered Ne Muni to be a fabrication.[22] Indologist Sylvain Levi found Lassen's theory untenable but had no
        theories of his own, only suggesting that either Newara is a vulgarism of sanskritic Nepala, or Nepala is
        Sanskritisation of the local ethnic;[23] his view has found some support though it does not answer the question
        of etymology.[24][25][26][17] It has also been proposed that Nepa is a Tibeto-Burman stem consisting of Ne
        (cattle) and Pa (keeper), reflecting the fact that early inhabitants of the valley were Gopalas (cowherds) and
        Mahispalas (buffalo-herds).[17] Suniti Kumar Chatterji believed Nepal originated from Tibeto-Burman roots – Ne,
        of uncertain meaning (as multiple possibilities exist), and pala or bal, whose meaning is lost entirely.[27]</p>


        

    <h3 id="history">History</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had
        earlier evolved.[28][29][30] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years
        ago.[31] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human settlements in Nepal dates to around the same
        time.[32]

        After 6500 BC, evidence for the domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures,
        and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan.[33] These
        gradually developed into the Indus Valley civilisation,[34][33] the first urban culture in South Asia.[35]
        Prehistoric sites of palaeolithic, mesolithic and neolithic origins have been discovered in the Siwalik hills of
        Dang district.[36] The earliest inhabitants of modern Nepal and adjoining areas are believed to be people from
        the Indus Valley civilisation. It is possible that the Dravidian people whose history predates the onset of the
        Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other ethnic
        groups like the Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans from across the border.[37] By 4000 BC, the Tibeto-Burmese people
        had reached Nepal either directly across the Himalayas from Tibet or via Myanmar and north-east India or
        both.[38] Stella Kramrisch (1964) mentions a substratum of a race of pre-Dravidians and Dravidians, who were in
        Nepal even before the Newars, who formed the majority of the ancient inhabitants of the valley of Kathmandu.[39]

        By the late Vedic period, Nepal was being mentioned in various Hindu texts, such as the late Vedic Atharvaveda
        Pariśiṣṭa and in the post-Vedic Atharvashirsha Upanishad.[40] The Gopal Bansa was the oldest dynasty to be
        mentioned in various texts as the earliest rulers of the central Himalayan kingdom known by the name
        'Nepal'.[41] The Gopalas were followed by Kiratas who ruled for over 16 centuries by some accounts.[42]
        According to the Mahabharata, the then Kirata king went to take part in the Battle of Kurukshetra. In the
        south-eastern region, Janakpurdham was the capital of the prosperous kingdom of Videha or Mithila, that extended
        down to the Ganges, and home to King Janaka and his daughter, Sita.

        Around 600 BC, small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern regions of Nepal. From one of
        these, the Shakya polity, arose a prince who later renounced his status to lead an ascetic life, founded
        Buddhism, and came to be known as Gautama Buddha (traditionally dated 563–483 BC).[43] Nepal came to be
        established as a land of spirituality and refuge in the intervening centuries, played an important role in
        transmitting Buddhism to East Asia via Tibet,[44] and helped preserve Hindu and Buddhist manuscripts.

        By 250 BC, the southern regions had come under the influence of the Maurya Empire. Emperor Ashoka made a
        pilgrimage to Lumbini and erected a pillar at Buddha's birthplace, the inscriptions on which mark the starting
        point for properly recorded history of Nepal.[45] Ashoka also visited the Kathmandu valley and built monuments
        commemorating Gautama Buddha's visit there. By the 4th century AD, much of Nepal was under the influence of the
        Gupta Empire.[f][46]

        In the Kathmandu valley, the Kiratas were pushed eastward by the Licchavis, and the Licchavi dynasty came into
        power c. 400 AD. The Lichchhavis built monuments and left a series of inscriptions; Nepal's history of the
        period is pieced together almost entirely from them.[47][44] In 641, Songtsen Gampo of the Tibetan Empire sends
        Narendradeva back to Licchavi with an army and subjugates Nepal. Parts of Nepal and Licchavi was later under the
        direct influences of the Tibetan empire.[48] The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late 8th century and
        was followed by a Thakuri rule. Thakuri kings ruled over the country up to the middle of the 11th century AD;
        not much is known of this period that is often called the dark period.[49]</p>


    <h3 id="geography">Geography</h3>
    <p>Nepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape, about 800 kilometres (500 mi) long and 200 kilometres (120 mi) wide, with
        an area of 147,516 km2 (56,956 sq mi). It lies between latitudes 26° and 31°N, and longitudes 80° and 89°E.
        Nepal's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian plate, then part of the
        southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west,
        and later, south and south-east.[75] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyn oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to
        subduct under the Eurasian plate.[75] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both
        created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to
        uplift the Himalayas.[75] The rising barriers blocked the paths of rivers creating large lakes, which only broke
        through as late as 100,000 years ago, creating fertile valleys in the middle hills like the Kathmandu Valley. In
        the western region, rivers which were too strong to be hampered, cut some of the world's deepest gorges.[76]
        Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with
        river-borne sediment[77] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[78] Nepal lies almost completely within
        this collision zone, occupying the central sector of the Himalayan arc, nearly one-third of the 2,400 km (1,500
        mi)-long Himalayas,[79][80][81][82][83][84] with a small strip of southernmost Nepal stretching into the
        Indo-Gangetic plain and two districts in the northwest stretching up to the Tibetan plateau.[76]</p>


    <h3 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The bulk of energy in Nepal comes from biomass (80%) and imported fossil fuels (16%).[229] Most of the final
        energy consumption goes to the residential sector (84%) followed by transport (7%) and industry (6%); the
        transport and industry sectors have been expanding rapidly in recent years.[229] Except for some lignite
        deposits, Nepal has no known oil, gas or coal deposits.[229] All commercial fossil fuels (mainly oil, LPG and
        coal) are imported, spending 129% of the country's total export revenue.[230] Only about 1% of the energy need
        is fulfilled by electricity.[229] The perennial nature of Nepali rivers and the steep gradient of the country's
        topography provide ideal conditions for the development of hydroelectric projects. Estimates put Nepal's
        economically feasible hydro-power potential at approximately 42,000 MW.[229] Nepal has been able to exploit only
        about 1,100 MW. As most of it is generated from run-of-river (ROR) plants, the actual power produced is much
        lower in the dry winter months when peak demand can reach as high as 1,200 MW, and Nepal needs to import as much
        as 650 MW from India to meet the demands.[231] Major hydro-power projects suffer delays and
        setbacks.[232][233][234] Nepal's electrification rate (76%) is comparable to that of other countries in the
        region but there is significant disparity between the rural (72%) and urban (97%) areas.[229] The position of
        the power sector remains unsatisfactory because of high tariffs, high system losses, high generation costs, high
        overheads, over staffing, and lower domestic demand.[235]</p>

    <p>Traditional Nepali society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Nepali caste system embodies much of the
        social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in South Asia. Social classes are defined by
        more than a hundred endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or "castes". Nepal declared
        untouchability to be illegal in 1963[296] and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social
        welfare initiatives. At the workplace and educational institutions in urban Nepal, caste-related identification
        has pretty much lost its importance.[citation needed]

        Family values are important in the Nepali tradition, and multi-generational patriarchal joint families have been
        the norm in Nepal, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas. An overwhelming majority of
        Nepalis, with or without their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders.
        Marriage is thought to be for life, and the divorce rate is extremely low, with less than one in a thousand
        marriages ending in divorce.[297] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before
        reaching 18.[298]</p>
