                            <p>Before the unification of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley was known as Nepal.[c] The precise
                                origin of
                                the term Nepāl is uncertain. Nepal appears in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far
                                back as the
                                fourth century BC.[which?] An absolute chronology can not be established, as even the
                                oldest texts
                                may contain anonymous contributions dating as late as the early modern period. Academic
                                attempts to
                                provide a plausible theory are hindered by the lack of a complete picture of history and
                                insufficient understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman
                                languages.[17]

                                According to Hindu mythology, Nepal derives its name from an ancient Hindu sage called
                                Ne, referred
                                to variously as Ne Muni or Nemi. According to Pashupati Purāna, as a place protected by
                                Ne, the
                                country in the heart of the Himalayas came to be known as Nepāl.[18][19][d] According to
                                Nepāl
                                Mahātmya,[e] Nemi was charged with protection of the country by Pashupati.[20] According
                                to Buddhist
                                mythology, Manjushri Bodhisattva drained a primordial lake of serpents to create the
                                Nepal valley
                                and proclaimed that Adi-Buddha Ne would take care of the community that would settle it.
                                As the
                                cherished of Ne, the valley would be called Nepāl.[21] According to Gopalarājvamshāvali,
                                the
                                genealogy of ancient Gopala dynasty compiled c. 1380s, Nepal is named after Nepa the
                                cowherd, the
                                founder of the Nepali scion of the Abhiras. In this account, the cow that issued milk to
                                the spot,
                                at which Nepa discovered the Jyotirlinga of Pashupatināth upon investigation, was also
                                named Ne.[17]

                                Norwegian indologist Christian Lassen had proposed that Nepāla was a compound of Nipa
                                (foot of a
                                mountain) and -ala (short suffix for alaya meaning abode), and so Nepāla meant "abode at
                                the foot of
                                the mountain". He considered Ne Muni to be a fabrication.[22] Indologist Sylvain Levi
                                found Lassen's
                                theory untenable but had no theories of his own, only suggesting that either Newara is a
                                vulgarism
                                of sanskritic Nepala, or Nepala is Sanskritisation of the local ethnic;[23] his view has
                                found some
                                support though it does not answer the question of etymology.[24][25][26][17] It has also
                                been
                                proposed that Nepa is a Tibeto-Burman stem consisting of Ne (cattle) and Pa (keeper),
                                reflecting the
                                fact that early inhabitants of the valley were Gopalas (cowherds) and Mahispalas
                                (buffalo-herds).[17] Suniti Kumar Chatterji believed Nepal originated from Tibeto-Burman
                                roots – Ne,
                                of uncertain meaning (as multiple possibilities exist), and pala or bal, whose meaning
                                is lost
                                entirely.[27]</p>

                                to variously as Ne Muni or Nemi. According to Pashupati Purāna, as a place protected by
                                Ne, the
                                country in the heart of the Himalayas came to be known as Nepāl.[18][19][d] According to
                                Nepāl
                                Mahātmya,[e] Nemi was charged with protection of the country by Pashupati.[20] According
                                to Buddhist
                                mythology, Manjushri Bodhisattva drained a primordial lake of serpents to create the
                                Nepal valley
                                and proclaimed that Adi-Buddha Ne would take care of the community that would settle it.
                                As the
                                cherished of Ne, the valley would be called Nepāl.[21] According to Gopalarājvamshāvali,
                                the
                                genealogy of ancient Gopala dynasty compiled c. 1380s, Nepal is named after Nepa the
                                cowherd, the
                                founder of the Nepali scion of the Abhiras. In this account, the cow that issued milk to
                                the spot,
                                at which Nepa discovered the Jyotirlinga of Pashupatināth upon investigation, was also
                                named Ne.[17]

                                Norwegian indologist Christian Lassen had proposed that Nepāla was a compound of Nipa
                                (foot of a
                                mountain) and -ala (short suffix for alaya meaning abode), and so Nepāla meant "abode at
                                the foot of
                                the mountain". He considered Ne Muni to be a fabrication.[22] Indologist Sylvain Levi
                                found Lassen's
                                theory untenable but had no theories of his own, only suggesting that either Newara is a
                                vulgarism
                                of sanskritic Nepala, or Nepala is Sanskritisation of the local ethnic;[23] his view has
                                found some
                                support though it does not answer the question of etymology.[24][25][26][17] It has also
                                been
                                proposed that Nepa is a Tibeto-Burman stem consisting of Ne (cattle) and Pa (keeper),
                                reflecting the
                                fact that early inhabitants of the valley were Gopalas (cowherds) and Mahispalas
                                (buffalo-herds).[17] Suniti Kumar Chatterji believed Nepal originated from Tibeto-Burman
                                roots – Ne,
                                of uncertain meaning (as multiple possibilities exist), and pala or bal, whose meaning
                                is lost
                                entirely.[27]</p>

                            <p>Before the unification of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley was known as Nepal.[c] The precise
                                origin of
                                the term Nepāl is uncertain. Nepal appears in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far
                                back as the
                                fourth century BC.[which?] An absolute chronology can not be established, as even the
                                oldest texts
                                may contain anonymous contributions dating as late as the early modern period. Academic
                                attempts to
                                provide a plausible theory are hindered by the lack of a complete picture of history and
                                insufficient understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman
                                languages.[17]

                                According to Hindu mythology, Nepal derives its name from an ancient Hindu sage called
                                Ne, referred

                                Nepāl
                                Mahātmya,[e] Nemi was charged with protection of the country by Pashupati.[20] According
                                to Buddhist
                                mythology, Manjushri Bodhisattva drained a primordial lake of serpents to create the
                                Nepal valley
                                and proclaimed that Adi-Buddha Ne would take care of the community that would settle it.
                                As the
                                cherished of Ne, the valley would be called Nepāl.[21] According to Gopalarājvamshāvali,
                                the
